" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This

" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).

" By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
" shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "

" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
" for more information on this.
